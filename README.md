## Welcome to My Simulation Laboratory ðŸ‘‹

In this space, I explore and document advanced numerical methods, focusing on energy-stable, high-order techniques for solving well-posed partial differential equations (PDEs). I also develop and implement gradient-based optimization tools tailored for complex research problems and real-world industrial applications.

With a strong foundation in computational mathematics and a passion for innovative problem-solving, my work aims to push the boundaries of simulation accuracy and efficiency. From fluid dynamics to structural analysis, these tools are designed to tackle the most demanding challenges in engineering and scientific computing.

If you are looking for expertise in high-performance numerical modeling, optimization, or cutting-edge simulation methods, youâ€™re in the right place!
