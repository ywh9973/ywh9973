## Welcome to My Simulation Laboratory ðŸ‘‹

In this space, I document advanced numerical methods, focusing on energy-stable, high-order techniques for solving well-posed partial differential equations (PDEs). I also explore custom experimental gradient-based optimization tools tailored for research problems and real-world industrial applications. If you are looking for ready-to-use packaged codes in numerical modeling, optimization, simulation methods, youâ€™re in the right place!
